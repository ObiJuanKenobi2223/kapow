About
=====

Kapow is a punch clock program designed to easily keep track of your hours,
whether you're working on one project or many. Simply clock in and out with
the Start/Stop button. If you make a mistake in your hours, you can go back
and edit any of the entries by double-clicking on the session in question.
Kapow also allows you to easily keep track of the hours since you last
billed a client, by providing a helpful "Billed" checkbox--the totals will
reflect your work after the last billed session.


Portable Mode
=============

Create a folder named "Data" in the same folder as the executable (the
application bundle if using Mac OS X) to run this program from a USB drive.
Simply rename or delete the "Data" folder if you later decide you want it
to start storing its settings and related files on the host computer.
